From COVID Watch List / watch list table

032019 = 
CALCULATE(
SUM('ahi sales'[SALES]),
FILTER ('CALENDARLOOKUP', 'CALENDARLOOKUP'[DATE].[YEAR] IN {2019}),
FILTER ('CALENDARLOOKUP', 'CALENDARLOOKUP'[DATE].[MONTH] IN {"March"})
)

From DASHBOARD / Measure Table table

BCAFT = 
CALCULATE(
SUM('FY20 AHI daily'[Sales]).
FILTER ('FY20 AHI daily', 'FY20 AHI daily'[HB] IN {"AFT"}),
FILTER('FY20 AHI daily', 'FY20 AHI daily'[Invoice Date] < TODAY () - 365)
)

This approach will stop the SUM from crossing all dates. Instead, you will only use the SUM function on the last date of the time period, thus effectively creating a semi-additive measure.
Last Inventory Count =
CALCULATE (
    SUM ( 'Warehouse'[Inventory Count] ),
    LASTDATE ( 'Date'[Date] ))
