See RiverPoint Inventory Tracker for USERELATIONSHIP example.

MasterTracker has 4 item#s- need to match with CombinedInventory (ahi and pvs inventory files appended as new)
created the 4 relationships combining the MasterTracker item numbers ([AHI Archive],[PVS Archive],[PIV MPN],[PIV PVS]) to CombinedInventory[Item#] - 3 of which could not be "active"

Needed to show which inventory was at AHI vs PVS.  On new product, shows if it has pulled through from Precision to the FCs. 
AHIArchInv = CALCULATE(
    SUM('CombinedInventory'[Qty]), 
    USERELATIONSHIP ('CombinedInventory'[Item#], 'MasterTracker'[AHI Archive])
    )
   
PIVMPNInv = CALCULATE(
    SUM('CombinedInventory'[Qty]), 
    USERELATIONSHIP ('CombinedInventory'[Item#], 'MasterTracker'[PIV MPN])
    )
