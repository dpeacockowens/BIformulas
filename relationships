The preceding screenshot shows an established relationship between the Date and OrderDate columns, as shown by the highlighted line connecting the two. The solid line between the two tables indicates that it is the active relationship, meaning that by default, any slicing on the date table where measures in the Sales data are being displayed will be along the OrderDate column. A dashed relationship exists between the Date and ShipDate columns, indicating that it is the inactive relationship. This relationship will never be used unless explicitly declared in a measure.

To create this calculated measure for Sales by Ship Date, you can use the DAX function USERELATIONSHIP(). This function is used to specify a relationship to be used in a specific calculation and is done without overriding any existing relationships. It is a beneficial feature in that it allows developers to make additional calculations on inactive relationships by overriding the default active relationship between two tables in a DAX expression, as shown in the following example:

Sales by Ship Date = CALCULATE(Sales[TotalPrice], USERELATIONSHIP('Calendar'[Date], Sales[ShipDate]))
