In addition, one way to avoid using a calculated column is to use one of the X functions, such as SUMX, COUNTX, MINX, and so on. The X functions are beyond the scope of this module; however, they allow you to create measures that are aware of the data in individual rows and calculate totals based on the totals in the row. These functions are called iterator functions because, though they are used in measures, they iterate over the individual rows to do their calculations. An X function will perform better and use less disk space than a calculated column.

Calculated column values are stored in the Power BI .pbix file. Each calculated column will increase the space that is used in that file and potentially increase the refresh time.

Measures do not add to the overall disk space of the Power BI .pbix file.
