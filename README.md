# BIformulas

My main work right now involves Power BI and I love it.  Since our fiscal year does not start on the first of the year - or even on the first of a specific month - time related stuff can be a pain for me.  Also, we have 2 separate SAP systems that do NOT talk to each other (the tragedy of mergers) and my department's product sell on both sides of the business so I download from the two systems and bring them together as each product has 2 SKUs.

So this is basically a place to put my notes and formulas that are helpful to me because I have things strewn across over a dozen BI projects and need to have a place to keep it all together as my 54 year old mind tends to forget stuff!
